1. Callbacks

* :Callbacks Are Functions Which Are Passed Into Another Function And Are Intended To Be Called Back At A Later Point. #Usually because the reults will not be available until later on in the pt. 

2. Asynchronous Functions

* :Callback Are Also Often Used In :Asynchronous Methods, Something That Javascript Supports Which Allows Multiple Functions To Be Running In THe Background And Only Run When Needed/Called. 

* A Great Way To Demonstrate The JS Asynchronous Functions Is Via Browsers EventListener Capabilities And Windows Set Interval Function. 

3. IIFE

* Immediately-Invoked Function Expression Is A Javascript Programming Pattern That Wraps All Code To Be Included In A Lexical Scope (Via Creating An Anynomous Function And Running It Immediately.) This Causes All Variables Declared Inside The Function To Be Truly Private And It Only Deals With Window.objects When It Absolutely Has To. # It is a good idea to start your codw with ;, then wrap everything in a parantheses and end with another ;.
