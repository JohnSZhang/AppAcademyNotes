1. What Is Recursion?

- Recursion Is When You Break A Complex Problem Down Into Smaller Components Until They Are Simple Enoug That Solution Becomes Trivial. This Trivial Case Is Called The Base Case, And The Divided Problem Called A Subproblem.

2. How To Use Recursion

- Using Recursion Is An Example Of Inductive Reasoning Which Build Things Part By Part. First You Find Out How To Grow A Small Solution To A Bigger One And Then You Find The Base Cases.

- Beware Of Infinite Loops, Your Recursion Should Always Be Going Somewhere

- To Use Effectively, Keep In Mind That It Should : 

* Be Mapped Out Ahead Of Time, Think About And Even Sketch It Out First

* Identify Base Case, Once Defined Keep It In Sight While Recursing, Think About When The Stack Stops Growing

* Think About The First Link Up Base Case. This Will Be Generalizable And Is Therefore Crucial

* The Value Type Of Method Return Must Be Same As The Method Has To Get And Return The Same Thing For The Last/Next Level Of Recursion.
