:BackBone :Models

1. Model Basics

* Models In BackBone Are All Extensions Of The Backbone.Model Object ( The Extend Function Simly Merge In The First Object Passed In As An Argument With The This Object ). #Like all other backbone components, use the Backbone.Model.Extend({Your Code Here}) To Create Your Own Class

* Models Should Contain An :initialize Property That Will Be Run When A New Object Is Created And A :defaults Property Which Will Be An Object That Contain New Instances Default Properties. #This initialize function often take an object of properties to set initially. 

2. Using Models

* Models :set() Method Takes An Object With Property -> Value Pairs And Sets Them While :get() Takes String Of Property Name And Gives Value Back. #All data ultimately are stored in the models attributes property, and getter and setters are just there to provide abstraction. 

* The Backbone Models :on() Method Takes An Event Name And Calls The Callback Fucntion Very Similar To JQuerys On. (Except The Strings Are Not DOM Defaults)

* Backbone Models Follow The RESTful Protocal. Use The :id Attribute To Identify Entities. (Set The :urlRoot Property To Let It Know Where To Go). New Objects Will Be Created When :id Is Missing And :save() Is Called Via The POST Request, Else A Put Request Is Sent. 

* :fetch() Is Used To Get A Model From Database (If We Already Have An Id Property), We Can Pass An Options Object To Fetch With A Success Callback Function. To Delete The Same Mode, Use The :destroy() Method. 

3. Model Propertyies

* All Models On Clients Backbone Service Has A :cid Property To Uniquely Identity Them (Like A pid). This Is Different From Regular :id Which Would Be Rail Based. 

* The Models :save() Method Makes Ajax Request (Will Do The Correct One Depending On What The Status Of The Object Is), It Takes Key/Value Arguments, Or An Object With Key Value Pairs To Save, And Options Which Can Contain Success/Failure Callback Functions. #The callbacks get model, response, options arguments passed, respectively. 

4. Best Practices

* Use Model.toJSON() For A Copy Of A Model, While Using A Models :attribute To Get Its Actual Attributes (Dont Do This). It Can Also Be A Good Idea To Add Model Level Validations To Backbone Models Before Saving To Database. 

* Use :escape() (An Underscore Property) To Escape Model Properties While Rendering As That Keeps Things Safe
