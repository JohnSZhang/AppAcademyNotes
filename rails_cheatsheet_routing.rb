:Rails :Server :And :Routing

1. Resouce Routing

* Router Takes 2 Arguments, The HTTP Protocal (:GET, :POST, :CREATE, :PATCH, :DELETE) And A Path String (/all/the/best_posts/) And Figures Out What Controller Should Be Called. 

* Rails :resource/:resources Keyword Will Automatically Map Basic HTTP Requestions To Rail Model Controllers. # Index for all (or no id param), New for new, create for POST data, Show For get with ID, edit for id/edit, update for PATCH/PUT with ID, and Destroy for DELETE 

* The :id Section Of Rails Router Is The Dynamic Segment That Matches Any String Not Containing /. # All that the router does is to match correct requests to the correct method, there should be no business logic

* The root to: Command Sets Default Page Of Your Site, Also Very Useful. 

* Often Times Certain Resources Are Children Of Others, In Those Cases They Should Be Nested In Order To Model The Relationship. # Can even specify which controller methods are available in the nest (Usually only allow index method and only one level of nesting). Otherwise all routes will be generated. 

* In Order To Have Clean Design, Every Single Representation Of A Resource Should Be Mapped To Only One URL. # For example theres no point in including the parent id if children can and should be found by their own ids.

* The rake: routes: Command Show All Available Routes And What They Map To, Very Useful. 


2. Controllers

* Controllers Is Reponsible For Making Sense Of Requests And Get Data From Models, To Fetch/Save/Process Data And Get The Right Response. 

* Controller Names Should Be Plural, Just As Resources/Model Name Should Be Plural. 

* Rail Projects Have Master ApplicationControll Which Extends ActionController That All Individual Controllers Subclass From. 

* Paramester Which Are Sent As Part Of Url Are Available In Hash Like Objects In ActionController::Base.Params (It Is A Method NOT A HASH). Other Posible Souce Of Params Is In The POST/PATCH Body Which Can Also Be Gathered As Body Magically Combines The Two. 

* Mass Assignment, Ie. Create(@params) Would Not Work As We Need To Restrcit Via The :Params.Permit: Method Of Rail Controller. (Whitelist, Else Injections Anyone?) #Another section is the method (get, post, etc) and the :ID Param

* Rail Router Creates The Controller Object Once Routed, Then Calls The Approprite Method On That Controller Object. Once The Controller Does What It Has To Do To Process The Request, Connection Is Closed And Controller Disgarded. 

3. Helpers

* When Resources Routes Are Created In Rail, Routing Helpers Methods Are Also Created. These Include :objects_url (Index Url), :new_object_url (New Url), :object_url (@object) (Specific ID URL), And :edit_object_url (@object) (Object IDs Edit Page) #These are useful and should always be used.

* It Is Also Possible To Pass Additional Embed Query-String Objects To URL Helper Creations. #Also prefer the full url version over simply the path version

* Lots Of Rails Methods Take An Optional :method Parameter That Changes What The URL Does Greatly. 

4. Mailers

* Mails Are Objects Off The ActionMailer::Base Class And Lives In app/mailers. In Email Set Mail To, Subject, Etc. A Mail Is Only Send Once The :deliver Method Is Called.
