1. Primitive Types

* Js Has 5 Types Of Primitives Data Types : Number, Boolean, String, Null, And Undefined.

* Because Javascript Is Dynamically Typed, Types Are Converted When Methods Take Incompatible Arguments. # Is is always a good idea to use === whenever evaluating equality of two objects, as this does not force conversion of variable types and cause weird issues.
