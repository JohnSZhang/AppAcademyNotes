1. Dependencies

* It Is Always A Good Idea To Define A :package.json File That Others What The Application Dependencies Are. Use It To Define Name Of Your App, Its Version, And Dependent Libraries.

* Use :npm Install To Get The Dependencies (Its Just Like Rubys Gems) It Is Also A Good Idea To Put Down The Repository Name/Infor And A Readme File.

2. MIME

3. Caching
