1. What Are They? Data Structures Are Ways To Both Store And Organize Data For Easy Selection

2. Trees

- Trees Are Data Structures That Represent Data In An Hierarchy. Each Element In The Tree Is Called A Node And Has Links To Lower Levels Of The Tree. 

- The Very Top Node Is Called The Root. Children(Sub Level-One Nodes). The Bottom Most Level Of The Tree Is Called Leaves As They Do Not Have Anything Below Them. 

- Binary Trees, A Special Kind Of Tree, Has Only Two Children Per Node And They Are Called The Right And Left Children

3.Search Algorithem

- If We Have A Tree And Which To Go Over All Nodes On The Tree We Have Two Basic Ways Of Doing So, Depth First Search And Breath First Search.

- Depth First Search (DFS) Travels Through The Tree By Going Through One Leave At A Time. # IE for a binary tree we would go all the way left then go left left left... right

- Breath First Search (BFS) Travels Through The Tree By Going Through Every Node Possible On A Level Before Going Further Down. #IE for a binary tree we would go left, right, then left left, then left right, ...
